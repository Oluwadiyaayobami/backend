so basically  the node file system is combined with the path functionality to be able to mange fike storage file ceration and they have therir principle to cerate a folder we use fs.mkdir(filepath ,(error) => {
    and how we want to settle the error 
})
and also to cerate a file we use fs.writefile(it takes the file path where the file should be made and takes what u want to add to the file and also the erro )
noe u have to cerate the file path for ur folder that u wantto addthe fiel to okay 

to read a file we use the fs.readfilesync(pass the file path and utf8)
that would read the file in the part cerated 

we also have a funti=onality to append file useing the fs.appendfilesync(file path. what u wnt to add)


and also there is an asncy way to do all this and its better forerror handling
