so basically  the node file system is combined with the path functionality to be able to mange fike storage file ceration and they have therir principle to cerate a folder we use fs.mkdir(filepath ,(error) => {
    and how we want to settle the error 
})
and also to cerate a file we use fs.writefile(it takes the file path where the file should be made and takes what u want to add to the file and also the erro )
noe u have to cerate the file path for ur folder that u wantto addthe fiel to okay
