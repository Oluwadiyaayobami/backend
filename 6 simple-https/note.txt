the http module allow interaction it allow u to give a request and generate a response 
basicaly u have to get the http module by useing the require('http')
then u have to cerate server this is like server = http.cerateserver ((req,res) =>{
    then u hvae to write ur response head this is basicaly res.writehead (it accept ur response statuse and also the trype of reswponse u want to generate)
    the u have to end the response by res.end('pass in the vaue of ur response )
})
the u have to cerate ur server  this is done by assening a port 
const port  = 3000 
then u write the code for the server to lestien 
server.lestien(port, ()=> {
    a callback to the function that alll 
})

so basically weuse the the req.url to set routhing function to our code and cerate end point
